# Differential-Drive-ROS2-Navigation-Project
This repository demonstrates a complete SLAM, localization, and navigation pipeline for a four-wheeled differential drive robot using ROS 2 Humble, Gazebo (Harmonic), SLAM Toolbox, AMCL, and Nav2.



## ðŸš€ Features
- **SLAM Mapping:** Creates a 2D occupancy map of the environment using SLAM Toolbox.
- **Localization:** Uses AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) to localize the robot within the generated map.
- **Navigation:** Employs Nav2 (Navigation 2) stack for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
- **Simulation:** Runs in Gazebo (Harmonic) with a differential drive robot model.
- **Visualization:** Supports RViz2 for real-time map and path visualization.
- **Image Monitoring:** Uses rqt_image_view to display camera feed from a gimbal-mounted camera.
- **Frame Inspection:** Includes tf2_tools view_frames for inspecting TF transform trees.
